         K-threshold Composite Signatures for the Internet PKI
                 draft-pala-klaussner-composite-kofn-00

Abstract

   With the need to evolve the cryptography used in today applications,
   devices, and networks, there might be many scenarios where the use of
   a single-key certificate is not sufficient.  For example, there might
   be the need for migrating between two existing algorithms (e.g., from
   classic to post-quantum) or there might be the need to test the
   capabilities of devices via test drivers and/or non-standard
   algorithms.

   Differently from the situation where algorithms are not yet (or no
   more) trusted to be used by themselves, this document addresses the
   use of multiple keys and signatures that can be individually trusted
   to implement a generic 1-threshold and K-threshold signature
   validation procedures.

   This document relies on the definition of CompositePublicKey,
   CompositePrivateKey, and CompositeSignature which are sequences of
   the respective structure for each component algorithm as defined in
   I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-keys and I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs
   respectively.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document is consistent with all terminology from
   [I-D.driscoll-pqt-hybrid-terminology].

   In addition, the following terms are used in this document:

   BER: Basic Encoding Rules (BER) as defined in [X.690].

   CLIENT: Any software that is making use of a cryptographic key.  This
   includes a signer, verifier, encrypter, decrypter.

   DER: Distinguished Encoding Rules as defined in [X.690].

   PKI: Public Key Infrastructure, as defined in [RFC5280].

   PUBLIC / PRIVATE KEY: The public and private portion of an asymmetric
   cryptographic key, making no assumptions about which algorithm.

   COMPONENT KEY: One component of the Composite Key. For example, an
   RSA, a Dilithium3 or a Falcon512 key.

2.  Introduction

   When the trust in the cryptographic algorithms is not static (e.g.,
   not enough crypto-analysis has happened yet or a new threat is
   envisioned to be deployable in the next future), there might be the
   need to combine multiple algorithms together to address the crypto-
   uncertainty of the envisioned period.

   An example of such a situation can be found in the planning for the
   transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQ or PQC).  While classic
   algorithms will still be trusted for some time (but we do not know
   how much), there is uncertainty as to the strength of the new
   cryptographic algorithms.  Unlike previous cryptographic algorithm
   migrations, the choice of when to migrate and which algorithms to
   migrate to, is not so clear.

   Even after the migration period, it may be advantageous for an entity
   cryptographic identity to be composed of multiple public-key
   algorithms by using a Post-Quantum/Traditional (PQ/T) or Post-
   Quantum/Post-Quantum (PQ/PQ) Hybrid scheme.

   For further considerations on the challenges related to crypto-
   agility, please refer to [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-keys].

   This document is intended for general applicability anywhere that
   keys are used within PKIX or CMS structures.

3.  Composite Crypto Keys

   In this document import the definition of Composite Keys as defined
   in [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-keys].

Internet-Draft              K-threshold Sigs                October 2022


   In this document we also import the definition of Composite
   Signatures as defined in [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs] and define
   the following signature structure:

   CompositeSignaturePlusValue ::= SEQUENCE {
       signatureSequence           CompositeSignatureValue
       requiredValidSignatures     INTEGER (1..MAX) OPTIONAL
   }

   The signatureSequence field is the value of the composite signature
   as defined in [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs] while the
   requiredValidSignature optional field is used to indicate the number
   of positive signatures required to consider the composite signature
   value.

   The signatureSequence field carries the Composite signature value
   (sequence of signatures) and an optional requiredValidSignatures
   field.

   The signer entity MAY use the requiredValidSignatures value to
   indicate to the verifier to perform signature validations using only
   a subset of the components in a Composite key instead of all the
   components as required in normal Composite validation.

   The value of the requiredValidSignatures field must be, if present,
   greater or equal to one (1) and MUST NOT be larger than the number of
   components keys used to generate the Composite signature.

4.  The Composite Crypto Plus model

   The Composite Crypto Plus signature model provides the possibility to
   modify the expected behavior of the signature validation process by
   allowing the signer to specify under which conditions the use of one
   (1) or more successful validation is to be considered sufficient for
   the Composite signature to be considered valid.

4.1.  1-threshold (1 of N) and K-threshold (K of N) signatures

   In order to implement the 1-threshold (1 of N) or K-threshold (K of
   N) validation policies, Composite signatures (sequence of signatures)
   are augmented with the requiredValidSignatures optional field.

   The signer MAY use the value of one (1) to indicate to the verifier
   that at least one (1) successful signature validation operations is
   required.  More validations MAY be performed, but they are not
   required.

Internet-Draft              K-threshold Sigs                October 2022


   The signer MAY use a value greater than one (1), such as two (2) or
   larger, to indicate to the verifier that at least two (2) or more
   successful signature validations are required to consider the
   signature valid.

4.2.  Signature Generation

   When generating CompositePlus signatures, the signer follows the same
   procedures as described in I-D.draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs-05.

4.3.  Signature Validation

   When validating CompositePlus signatures, the verifier follows the
   same procedures as described in Section 5.2 of I-D.draft-ounsworth-
   pq-composite-sigs-05 with the following modifications.

   If the optional requiredValidSignatures field is present in the
   signature, the verifier can modify the validation process as follows:

  Signature Verification Procedure::
     1. Check keys, signatures, and algorithms lists for consistency.

        If Error during Desequencing, or the three sequences have
        different numbers of elements, or any of the public keys
        P1, P2, .., Pn or algorithm identifiers A1, A2, .., An are
        composite with the OID id-alg-composite or an explicit composite
        OID then output "Invalid signature" and stop.

     2. Check each component signature individually, according to its
         algorithm specification.
         If any fail, then the entire signature validation fails.

       k := <validations-threshold>
       for i := 1 to n
            if not verify( Pi, M, Si, Ai ), then
              output "Invalid signature"
            if i >= k, then
              output "Valid Signature"

        if all succeeded, then
          output "Valid signature"

5.  Algorithm Identifiers

   This document does not define a separate sets of algorithms for
   Composite Keys and Composite Signatures.

   Both the generic composite OID and the specific combinations OIDs can
   be used together with the additional optional field.

6.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA considerations.
